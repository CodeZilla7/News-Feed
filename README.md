# News-Feed
This is a simple app (very simple) that fetches data from the News API in JSON format and parses the response.

I will update the code to make the app better and the code base cleaner. Now I have intergrated https://github.com/square/retrofit in my app and made use of caching.

There's a bug though : ( When the app is killed and there's no internet connection, the data that was cached doesn't load. I will fix this soon I hope. 

Another issue apart from the big apk size is that the cache keeps growing and growing yet the data is the same. Both of these will be fixed soon too.

Again, improvements and suggestions are greatly welcome!
