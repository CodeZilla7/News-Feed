# News-Feed
This is a simple (very simple) News Feed app that fetches data from
Guardian API using [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
and shows the list in a RecyclerView. For the app to work as expected,
you need an API Key from
[The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/) and then place
it in the  gradle.properties file inside the MyApiKey String.

This app is part of my learning process for Android app development
through the videos provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
This app was made using videos from
[Android Basics: Networking](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud843)
It's a motivator ahead of
[Nairobi Tech Week](https://nairobitechweek.com)
and thus my final submission will be made before April 19th hopefully.

The final update will hopefully make use of
[Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html).

There are many dependencies that have been set up for learning purposes
and thus unused libraries can be removed if needed.
Contributions are greatly appreciated.
