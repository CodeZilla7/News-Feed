This is a Kotlin app that fetches data from
Guardian API using [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
and shows the list in a RecyclerView. For the app to work as expected,
you need an API Key from
[The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/) and then place
it in the  gradle.properties file inside the MyApiKey String.

The UI state is represented using a Resource instance and the data is observed
using LiveData.

I have integrated 
[Android Architecture Components Libraries](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
like 
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
