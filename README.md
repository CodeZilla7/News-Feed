# News-Feed
This is a simple (very simple) News Feed app that fetches data from
Guardian API using [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
and shows the list in a RecyclerView. For the app to work as expected,
you need an API Key from
[The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/) and then place
it in the  gradle.properties file inside the MyApiKey String.

This app is part of my learning process for Android app development
through the videos provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
I'll be building and refining features when I learn something new.

I have intergrated the 
[Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
libraries like [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), 
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), 
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and 
[Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/).
 The app currently does not work as expected but this will be changed very soon. The project builds 
 successfully though.  

There are many dependencies that have been set up for learning purposes
and thus unused libraries can be removed if needed.
Contributions are greatly appreciated.
