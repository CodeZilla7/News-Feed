# News-Feed
This is a simple (very simple) News Feed app that fetches data from
Guardian API using [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
and shows the list in a RecyclerView. For the app to work as expected,
you need an API Key from
[The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/) and then place
it in the  gradle.properties file inside the MyApiKey String.

This app is part of my learning process for Android app development
through the videos provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
I'll be building and refining features when I learn something new.

I have integrated 
[Android Architecture Components Libraries](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
like 
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

There are many dependencies that have been set up for learning purposes
and thus unused libraries can be removed if needed.
Contributions are greatly appreciated.
